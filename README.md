Week 1 lab practical code for cryptography class 

This cipher is very bad as you can apply the exact same cipher to the encrypted message and see the answer - 13 + 13 puts you in the same place on the alphabet.

Ideally you could permutate the message but really we would just use RSA encryption with a public and private key of length being from 2048 - 4096 bits in length.
